This is a simple Snake-eat-fruit Game.
Move the snake around the screen and eat the red apples to grow.
Be careful, do not crash into the bounds of the board or the snake itself.
Once eating a fruit, you will get one point correspondingly.
You will win the game if the score = 60 (i.e., snake has to eat 60 apples)

Enhancement:
The game level and snake speed will be increased if the snake eats a certain amount of fruits.

Instruction:
Use Arrow Keys or A,W,D,S to change direction.
P - Pause/Resume
R - Restart
Q - Quit the game

Running the program:
 - the game takes 0, 1 or 2 parameters, framerate and speed.
   Framerate is usually between 25 and 60, and the speed can be between 1 and 10.
 - so to start a game at 60 fps with a speed of 5, you run "./snake 60 5"
 - by default, i.e. run "./snake" will assume fps = 30, speed = 3.

Development Environment:
 -Mac OSX EI Capitan
 -Terminal
